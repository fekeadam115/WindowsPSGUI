# WindowsPSGUI - PowerShell GUI For Windows


This is a project I intend to complete over time to get a better understanding of Python's GUI library, Tkinter.

So far, I plan to create a program that acts as a substitute to Windows PowerShell.

Ideas for features:

1. Show/Hide hidden files and folders
2. Change Power Plan
3. Task killer that provides simple information of non-Windows processes
4. Enable/Disable Hibernation
5. Windows Updates
6. System Scan
7. DISM

And so on...
